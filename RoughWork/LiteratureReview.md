# Customer Segmentation in eCommerce to improve customer experience using Data Mining and Machine Learning. 

## Literature Review

Marketing is considered the key part in any business types and categories from B2B to P2P as every business owner wants to create a unique position in their customer’s minds as well as satisfy customer needs. For which businesses have multiple marketing techniques to get the highest customer retention score by studying customer behavior towards every aspect of the business. For example, your regular grocery store owner understanding your usual shopping habits and to improve the relationship with you as the customer that store owner analyses your patterns and will suggest you the products which might be of your interests and majority of those times that product indeed turns out to be useful. But, with Shopping online that same recommendations and recognition of shopping behavior lacks to get the similar results. That is when we need the data mining and machine learning models to segment the customers accurately which would create a unique experience for every shopper with perfectly curated catalogue according to their requirements and liking. Application of such strategies will enhance the current technologies and improve the targeted marketing; customer retention also reduces the ‘loss in marketing’ (without such segmentation the marketing budget is wasted on promoting products to irrelevant audience) and inventory management. 

To increase profits in marketing, communicating with the customers to identify the customer’s wishes is the best way.[] With the development of customer-oriented behavior in business, growing attention has been paid to customers and their needs as one of the vital factors to gain higher profits (Cheng and Chen, 2009).  To achieve the suggested results, along with the good performance of the platform, we need to identify the best approach towards customer and market segmentation. Market segmentation can be defined as dividing a market into distinct groups of customers, with different needs, characteristics, or behavior, who might require separate products or who may respond differently to various combinations of marketing efforts (Kotler and Armstrong, 1999). Market segmentation can be performed based on several bases such as demographic, benefit, usage-rate, needs-based, behavioral, psychographic, geographic. The segmentation can also be implemented by the information generated on the platform while using the same such as the purchase history, product searches, review/ ratings on products, wish list etc. as well as similarity in the same information among other users and suggestions based on other user’s purchases, or categorizing the customers based on the price of products previously bought. As segmenting the customers is majorly focused on creating suggestions/ recommendations there is also possibility of implementing reverse platform which will make sure certain products should less likely be recommended to the customers like, if the customer has bought a product from certain category previously like a mobile or computer then they are less likely to purchase the same product in short period of time, etc.


### Data for Customer Segmentation:
Customer or market segmentation to create successful model requires customer data from multiple sources. Magneto[] uses categorization on the data into internal and external data.

**1. Predictive Modeling:**

**Definition:** Predictive modeling in customer segmentation involves using machine learning algorithms to predict future customer behaviors or outcomes based on historical data. This can include predicting customer churn, purchase likelihood, or response to marketing campaigns.

**Application:**
- **Churn Prediction:** Utilize classification algorithms, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to predict the likelihood of a customer churning. This enables proactive retention strategies for at-risk customers, reducing overall churn rates.

- **Purchase Likelihood:** Employ predictive models to estimate the probability of a customer making a purchase. This information can inform targeted marketing efforts, personalized promotions, and inventory management.

- **Response Modeling:** Predict how likely a customer is to respond positively to a specific marketing campaign. This allows for the optimization of marketing budgets by focusing efforts on customers with a higher probability of conversion.

**2. Personalization with Recommender Systems:**

**Definition:** Recommender systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze customer preferences and behavior, providing personalized recommendations for products, services, or content.

**Application:**
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Analyze user behavior and preferences to identify patterns and recommend products/services that similar users have liked. Collaborative filtering can be user-based or item-based, offering personalized suggestions.

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend items based on their features and the user's preferences. This approach leverages information about the items themselves and the user's past behavior to make personalized recommendations.

- **Hybrid Models:** Combine collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. Hybrid models leverage the strengths of both approaches, enhancing the personalization aspect.

**3. Sentiment Analysis:**

**Definition:** Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves using natural language processing and machine learning to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in customer reviews, feedback, or social media posts.

**Application:**
- **Product and Service Feedback:** Analyze customer reviews to understand the sentiment towards products or services. Positive sentiments can be leveraged for marketing campaigns, while negative sentiments can inform product improvements and customer service enhancements.

- **Brand Perception:** Monitor social media for mentions of the brand and analyze sentiment to gauge overall brand perception. This insight helps in crafting strategies to enhance brand reputation and address potential issues.

- **Customer Experience Feedback:** Evaluate sentiment in customer feedback to identify areas for improvement in the customer experience. Positive sentiment can be reinforced, and negative sentiment can guide initiatives to address pain points.

**4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction:**

**Definition:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction involves using machine learning to estimate the total value a customer is expected to bring to a business over their entire relationship.

**Application:**
- **Regression Models:** Use regression models to predict the future spending patterns of individual customers. This enables businesses to identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies to maximize their long-term profitability.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create features that capture relevant customer behavior and demographic information for CLV prediction. This could include factors such as purchase frequency, average transaction value, and customer loyalty metrics.

- **Dynamic CLV Models:** Implement dynamic CLV models that adjust predictions over time based on new customer behavior data. This ensures that CLV estimates remain accurate and reflective of changing customer dynamics.

By leveraging machine learning in these customer segmentation techniques, businesses can enhance the precision and efficiency of their marketing strategies, delivering more personalized and targeted experiences to their customers.
